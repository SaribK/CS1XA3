# CS 1XA3 Project02 Feedback
## README Documentation: 10/10
Comments: Very thorough.
## JavaScript: 40/40
Comments: Good job.
## Content: 18/20
Comments: I took a mark off for your percentage slider with your skills. Curtis specifically asked us to take marks off for this because you should instead just list all your skills...not 
with a percentage. You want employers to know you can do all of them, not "40%" of the time. Come talk to me about it if you want. Also, add more to your work experiences like your responsibilities. 
## HTML/CSS: 30/30
Good use of templates. Well done.
